# PopulationCount
Find the year with the greatest number alive

Since the name was not part of the desired output, there seemed no point
in dealing with parsing issues. I expect data to be in the form
<name> <year of birth> <year of death>
with fields separated by a space. The program is invoked by
providing the data filename in the run command, and prints the result
to standard output.
